## The Adani Portfolio of Companies

## Portfolio of Progress

At the heart of this Portfolio of Progress is a journey of evolution over the years. Like the ascending peaks of a mountain range, we have grown every year - not only on the strength of our business performance, but equally and importantly, through our steadfast commitment to environmental, social and governance practices underpinned by a culture of transparency.

The Adani portfolio of companies, headquartered in Ahmedabad, India, has been founded and promoted by the visionary industrialist Mr Gautam Adani. The operations of the portfolio commenced in 1988 with commodity trading business under the flagship company Adani Enterprises Limited (previously Adani Exports Limited).

The Adani portfolio of companies today stands amongst India's largest and fastest-growing diversified business portfolios spanning transport, logistics, energy and utility, materials, metals, mining and various B2C sectors. The portfolio comprises eleven publicly-traded companies, including four investment grade (IG)-rated businesses, and is India's sole Infrastructure Investment Grade bond issuer.

The Adani portfolio of companies is guided by the philosophy of 'Growth with Goodness', which emphasises sustainable and responsible development aligned with national priorities. To this end, ambitious ESG targets, with a focus on decarbonisation, have been set.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred to as the 'Ind AS') as notified the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III)

The financial statements have been prepared on going concern basis using historical cost, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

- 1) Derivative financial instruments, and
- 2) Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments).

Historical  cost  is  the  amount  of  cash  or  cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the consideration given  to  acquire  assets  at  the  time  of  their acquisition, or the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation, or at the amount of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liability in the normal course of business.

Financial statements are presented in ' which is the functional currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest crore as per the requirement of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, except where otherwise indicated. The Company has prepared the financial statements on the basis that it will continue to operate as a going concern.

The  standalone  financial  statements  provide comparative information in respect of the previous period.  The  accounting  policies  are  applied consistently to all the periods presented in the standalone financial statements.

## 3. Material accounting policies

## A. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at their cost of acquisition / installation / construction net of accumulated depreciation, and accumulated impairment losses, if any, except freehold nonmining land which is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for provisions are met.

Spares  which  meet  the  definition  of  property, plant and equipment are capitalised as on the date of acquisition. The corresponding old spares are derecognized on such date with consequent impact in the statement of profit and loss.

Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for their intended use as on the balance sheet date are disclosed as 'Capital work-in-progress'. Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any. Such items are classified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for their intended use. Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any. Advances given towards acquisition / construction of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current assets'.

Capital  Expenses  incurred  by  the  company  on construction/development of certain assets which are essential for production, supply of goods or for the access to any existing Assets of the company are recognised as Enabling Assets under Property, Plant and Equipment.

## Depreciation on property, plant, and equipment

The Company, based on technical assessment made by technical expert and management estimate, depreciates certain items of building, plant and equipment over estimated useful lives which are different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is calculated using 'Written down value method' for assets related to Captive Power Plant and using 'Straight line method' for other assets.

The Company identifies and depreciates cost of each component / part of the asset separately, if the component / part have a cost, which is significant to the total cost of the asset and has a useful life that is materially different from that of the remaining asset.

Depreciation on additions to property, plant and equipment is provided on a pro-rata basis from the date of acquisition, or installation, or construction, when the asset is ready for intended use.

Depreciation on an item of property, plant and equipment sold, discarded, demolished or scrapped, is provided upto the date on which the said asset is sold, discarded, demolished or scrapped.

Capitalised spares are depreciated over their own estimated useful life or the estimated useful life of the parent asset whichever is lower.

The Company reviews the residual value, useful lives and depreciation method on each reporting date and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

In respect of an asset for which impairment loss, if any, is recognised, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.

Property, plant, and equipment, constructed by the Company, but ownership of which vests with the Government / Local authorities:

- i. Expenditure on Power lines is depreciated over the period as permitted in the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 / 2003 as applicable.
- ii. Expenditure on Marine structures is depreciated over the period of the agreement.

| Plant and Equipment related to Captive Power Plant | 20 to 40 years                             | 40 years                          |

The Management believes that the useful lives as given above reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.

## II. Derecognition of property plant and equipment

An  item  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset)  is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.

## B. Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax / duty credits availed wherever applicable) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial

recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed during each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.

Stripping Cost - Stripping costs are allocated and included as a component of the mine asset when they represent significantly improved access to limestone, provided all the following conditions are met:

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

- a. it is probable that the future economic benefit associated  with  the  stripping  activity  will be realised.
- b. the component of the limestone body for which access has been improved can be identified; and
- c. the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.

## Derecognition of intangible assets

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, if any, are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.

## Contract based Intangibles

The Company recognizes contract-based intangible asset  when  the  economic  benefit  under  the

contract starts flowing to the entity and control over the intangible asset is established. Till the time such economic benefits start flowing to entity, it is disclosed under Other Non-current assets as 'Payment under Long term supply arrangement'. The Company reclassifies such balance to intangible assets once the economic benefit start accruing to the Company.

Contract based intangibles are initially recognized at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, contractbased intangibles are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The useful life of the contract-based intangibles for purpose of its amortization is considered to be shorter of the period of contractual rights or period over which entity expects to obtain economic benefits from the asset. Further, at every reporting date, the contract-based intangibles are also tested for impairment in case of an indication that the contract-based intangibles might be impaired.

## Amortisation of intangible assets

A summary of the policies applied to the Company's intangible assets are, as follows:

| Intangible assets    | Useful life            | Amortisation method used                                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Water drawing rights | Finite (10-30 years)   | Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life                      |
| Computer software    | Finite (upto 5 years)  | Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life                      |
| Mining rights        | Finite (upto 90 years) | Over the period of the respective mining agreement  on a straight-line basis |
| Sponsorship Rights   | Finite (upto 5 years)  | Amortised based on occurrence of event                                       |

## C. Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of other non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date if there is any indication of impairment based on internal / external factors. An impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent

of those from other assets of or Group of assets. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. A previously recognised impairment loss, if any, is reversed when there is an indication of reversal, however, the carrying value after reversal is not increased beyond the carrying value that would

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

have prevailed by charging usual depreciation / amortisation if there was no impairment.

## D. Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:

## I. Raw materials, stores and spare parts, fuel and packing material:

Cost  includes  purchase  price,  other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, and includes non-refundable taxes. Materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on a moving weighted average basis.

## II. Work-in-progress, finished goods and stock in trade:

Cost includes direct materials and labour and a  proportion  of  manufacturing  overheads based on normal operating capacity. Cost of Stock-in-trade includes cost of purchase and other cost incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost is determined on a moving weighted average basis.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## E. Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures

Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are accounted for at cost, net of impairment, if any.

## F. Fair value measurement

The Company measures its financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.

The  fair  value  measurement  is  based  on  the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

- a. In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
- b. In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at  the  measurement  date.  The  Company  uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.

External  valuers  are  involved  for  valuation  of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets and financial liabilities and derivatives.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company  determines  whether  transfers  have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured as disclosed in the financial statements

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described in Note 54.

## G. Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit and loss are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## I. Financial assets

## a. Initial recognition and measurement of financial assets

The Company recognises a financial asset in  its  balance  sheet  when  it  becomes party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of the instrument. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, plus in the case of financial assets not recorded at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

The  classification  of  financial  assets at  initial  recognition  depends  on  the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company's business model  for  managing  them.  With  the

exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient, the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a  significant  financing  component  or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the accounting policies in  section  (I)  Revenue  from  contracts with customers.

## b. Subsequent measurement of financial assets

All  recognised  financial  assets  are subsequently measured in their entirety at  either  amortised  cost  or  fair  value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

## Classification of Financial assets

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial  assets  are  classified  in  the following categories:

## Financial assets measured at amortised cost

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method ('EIR') (except for debt instruments that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition):

-  the  asset  is  held  within  a  business model whose objective is to hold assets in  order  to  collect  contractual  cash flows; and
-  Contractual  terms  of  the  asset  give rise  on  specified  dates  to  cash  flows that  are  solely  payments  of  principal

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

and  interest  (SPPI)  on  the  principal amount outstanding.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.

## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria are measured at FVTPL.

## c. Derecognition of financial assets

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

- i. The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
- ii. The  Company  has  transferred  its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement;  and  either  (a)  the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or  (b)  the  Company  has  neither transferred nor retained substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been

recognised in the statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.

## d. Impairment of financial assets

The Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss  on  financial  assets  measured  at amortised cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset.

The Company measures the loss allowance for  a  Trade  Receivables  and  Contract Assets by following 'simplified approach' at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. In case of other financial assets 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss and where credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.

The Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

## II. Financial liabilities and equity instruments

## a. Financial liabilities

## i. Initial recognition and measurement

The Company recognises a financial liability in its balance sheet when it becomes  party  to  the  contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.  The Company's financial liabilities majorly includes trade and other payables.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost as appropriate.

## ii. Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities that are not heldfor-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent reporting  periods.  The  carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest rate method.

## iii. Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative  financial  instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in  hedge  relationships  as  defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains  or  losses  on  liabilities  held for  trading  are  recognised  in  the statement of profit and loss account.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such

at  the  initial  date  of  recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.

## iv. Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender  on  substantially  different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## III. Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis,  to  realise  the  assets  and  settle  the liabilities simultaneously.

## H.  Provisions and contingencies

## I. Provisions

## Mines reclamation

The Company provides for the costs of restoring a mine where a legal or constructive obligation exists. The estimated future costs for known restoration requirements are determined on a mine-by-mine basis and are calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash out flows.

The restoration provision before exploitation of the raw materials has commenced is included in Property, Plant and Equipment and depreciated over the life of the related asset.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

The effect of any adjustments to the provision due to further environmental damage as a result of exploitation activities is recorded through the Statement of Profit and Loss over the life of the related asset, in order to reflect the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period.

Changes in the measurement of a provision that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of cash outflows, or a change in the discount rate, are added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset to the extent that they relate to the asset's installation, construction or acquisition.

Provisions are discounted to their present value. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## Other provisions:

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.

## II. Contingent liability

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from the past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events and that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources

embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The Company does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.

## I. Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised on the basis of approved contracts  regarding  the  transfer  of  goods  or services to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange of those goods or services.

## I. Sale of goods

Revenue from the sale of the goods is recognised when delivery has taken place and control of the goods has been transferred to the customer according to the specific delivery term that have been agreed with the customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations.

Revenue is measured after deduction of any discounts, price concessions, volume rebates and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government such as goods and services tax, etc. The Company accrues for such discounts, price  concessions  and  rebates  based  on historical experience and specific contractual terms with the customer.

The  disclosure  of  significant  accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3.1 (VI).

No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with credit terms largely ranging between 30 days and 60 days depending on the specific terms agreed with customers.

## II. Rendering of services

Income from services rendered is recognised at  a  point  in  time  based  on  agreements  / arrangements with the customers when the services  are  performed  and  there  are  no unfulfilled obligations.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

## III. Contract assets, Trade receivables and Contract liabilities:

## Contract asset:

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.

## Trade receivables

A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due and the amount is billable.

## Contract liabilities

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue  when  the  Company  performs obligations under the contract.

## IV. Interest income

Interest  income  from  a  financial  asset  is recognised  when  it  is  probable  that  the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.

## V. Dividends

Dividend  income  is  recognised  when  right to receive is established (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably).

## J. Retirement and other employee benefits

## I. Defined contribution plan

Employee benefits in the form of contribution to Superannuation Fund, Provident Fund managed by government authorities, Employees State Insurance Corporation and Labour Welfare Fund are considered as defined contribution plans and the same are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the year in which the employee renders the related service.

## II. Defined benefit plan

The Company's gratuity fund scheme, additional gratuity scheme and post-employment benefit scheme  are  considered  as  defined  benefit plans. The Company's liability is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method as at the balance sheet date.

Employee benefit, in the form of contribution to provident fund managed by a trust set up by the Company, is charged to statement of profit and loss for the year in which the employee renders the related service. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investment of  the  trust  and  interest  rate  notified  by the Government of India. Such shortfall is recognised in the statement of profit and loss based on actuarial valuation.

Past  service  costs  are  recognised  in  the statement of profit and loss on the earlier of:

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

- a. The  date  of  the  plan  amendment  or curtailment, and
- b. The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costs

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss:

- a. Service costs comprising current service costs,  past-service  costs,  gains  and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and
- b. Net interest expense or income
- c. Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if any), and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they  occur.  Re-measurements  are  not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.

## III. Short term employee benefits

Short term employee benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised as an expense at the undiscounted amount in the statement of profit and loss of the year in which the related service is rendered.

## IV. Other long-term employee benefits

Compensated absences are provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation, using the

projected unit credit method, as at the date of the balance sheet. Actuarial gains / losses, if any, are immediately recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Compensated absences, which are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service, are treated as short term employee benefits. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date.

Long  service  awards  and  accumulated compensated absences which are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are treated as other long term employee benefits for measurement purposes.

## V. Termination benefits

Termination  benefits  are  payable  when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Company recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following:

- a. when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits;
- b. when the Company recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of Ind AS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary  redundancy,  the  termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

## VI. Presentation and disclosure

For the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans, the allocation between the short term and long-term provisions have been made as determined by an actuary. Obligations under other long-term benefits are classified as shortterm provision, if the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the obligation beyond 12 months from the reporting date. The Company presents the entire compensated absences as short-term provisions since employee has an unconditional right to avail the leave at any time during the year.

## K. Taxation

Tax expense comprises current income tax and deferred income tax and includes any adjustments related to past periods in current and / or deferred tax adjustments that may become necessary due to certain developments or reviews during the relevant period.

## I. Current income tax

Current  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities are  measured  at  the  amount  expected  to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and recognise expense where appropriate.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.

## II. Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

-  When the deferred tax liability arises from the  initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give  rise  to  equal  taxable  and  deductible temporary differences
-  In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, when  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised, except:

-  When  the  deferred  tax  asset  relating  to the deductible temporary difference arises from  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset or  liability  in  a  transaction  that  is  not  a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
-  In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

temporary  differences  will  reverse  in  the foreseeable  future  and  taxable  profit  will be  available  against  which  the  temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The Company writes-down the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deferred tax asset can be realised. Any such writedown is reversed to the extent that it becomes reasonably certain that sufficient future taxable income will be available.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred  tax  relating  to  items  recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.

The Company applies significant judgment in  identifying  uncertainties  over  income tax treatments. Uncertain tax positions are reflected in the overall measurement of the Company's tax expense and are based on the most likely amount or expected value that is to be disallowed by the taxing authorities whichever better predict the resolution of uncertainty.  Uncertain  tax  balances  are monitored  and  updated  as  and  when  new information becomes available, typically upon examination or action by the taxing authorities or through statute expiration.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for  separate  recognition  at  that  date,  are recognised subsequently if new information about  facts  and  circumstances  change. Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill related to that acquisition if they result from new information obtained about facts and circumstances  existing  at  the  acquisition date. If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain purchase gains. All other acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in profit or loss.

In the situations where one or more units of the Company are entitled to a tax holiday under the tax law, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is recognised in respect of temporary differences which reverse during the tax holiday period, to the extent the concerned unit's gross total income is subject to the deduction during the tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect of temporary differences which reverse after the tax holiday period is recognised in the year in which the temporary differences originate. However, the Company restricts recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized. For recognition of deferred taxes,  the  temporary  differences  which originate first are considered to reverse first.

## L. Leases

The Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## I. Company as a lessee:

## Right-of-use assets

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset:

| Right of use assets   | Terms (in years)   |

The  right  of  use  assets  is  also  subject  to impairment. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

## Lease liabilities

Lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates.  The  Company  uses  the  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability include fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate known at the commencement date; and extension option payments or purchase options payments which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement the lease liability and the ROU asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or

condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in the line 'Other expenses' in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

The lease term comprises the non-cancellable lease term together with the period covered by extension options, if assessed as reasonably certain to be exercised, and termination options, if assessed as reasonably certain not to be exercised. For lease arrangement in respect of ships, the non-lease components are not separated from lease components and instead account for each lease component, and any associated non-lease component as a single lease component.

The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest  on  the  lease  liabilities,  reducing the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  the  lease payments made.

ROU  asset  and  lease  liabilities  have  been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value (range different for different class of assets). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.

## M.  Government grants and subsidies

Government grants are recognised when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attaching conditions will be complied with.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

Where the grants relate to an item of expense, they are recognised as income on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs, which they are intended to compensate.

Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.

When the Company receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair value amounts and released to the statement of profit and loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset.

When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognised and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently measured as per the accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities.

## N.  Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity holders of parent company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.

Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing the profit after tax as adjusted for dividend, interest and other charges to expense or income (net of any attributable taxes) relating to the dilutive potential equity shares, by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.

## O. Foreign currencies translations

The Company's standalone financial statements are presented in ( ' ), which is also the Company's functional currency.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

Non-monetary items which are carried in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

## P. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for the purpose of standalone statement of cash flows comprise cash at banks and on hand, shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and investment in liquid mutual funds that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

## Q. Dividend

The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity holders of the parent when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

## R. Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities

The  operating  cycle  is  the  time  between  the acquisition  of  assets  for  processing  and  their realisation  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  The Company  has  identified  twelve  months  as  its operating cycle for determining current and noncurrent classification of assets and liabilities in the Balance sheet.

## 3.1  Use of estimates and judgments

The  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial statements  requires  management  to  make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and  are  based  on  historical  experience  and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future period, if the revision affects current and future period. Revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

## I. Classification of legal matters and tax litigations (Refer Note 47)

The litigations and claims to which the Company is exposed to are assessed by management with assistance of the legal department and in certain cases with the support of external specialised lawyers. Determination of the outcome of these matters into 'Probable, Possible and Remote' require judgement and estimation on case to case basis.

## II. Defined benefit obligations (Refer Note 50)

The cost of defined benefit gratuity plans, and post-retirement medical benefit is determined using  actuarial  valuations.  The  actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

## III. Useful life of property, plant and equipment (Refer Note 4)

The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value. Increasing an asset's expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the statement of profit and loss. The useful lives of the Company's assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for appropriateness. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

## IV.   Impairment of Property, plant and equipment (Refer Note 4)

Determining whether the property, plant and equipment are impaired requires an estimate of the value of use. In considering the value in  use,  the  management  has  anticipated the capacity utilization of plants, operating margins, mineable resources and availability of infrastructure of mines, and other factors of the underlying businesses / operations. Any subsequent changes to the cash flows due to changes in the above-mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

## V. Incentives under the State Industrial Policy (Refer Note 12 and 19)

The Company's manufacturing units in various states are eligible for incentives under the respective State Industrial Policy. The Company accrues  these  incentives  as  refund  claims in respect of VAT/GST paid, on the basis that all attaching conditions were fulfilled by the Company and there is reasonable assurance that the incentive claims will be disbursed by the State Governments.

The Company measures expected credit losses in a way that reflects the time value of money. Any subsequent changes to the estimated recovery period could impact the carrying value of Incentives receivable.

## VI.   Discounts / rebate to customers (Refer Note 36)

The Company provides discount and rebates on sales to certain customers. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price charged to the customer, net of the estimated pricing allowances,  discounts,  rebates,  and  other incentives. In certain cases, the amount of these discount and rebates are not determined until claims with appropriate evidence is presented by the customer to the Company, which may be some time after the date of sale. Accordingly, the Company estimates the amount of such incentives basis the terms of contract, incentive schemes, historical experience adjusted with the forward looking, business forecast and the current economic conditions. To estimate the amount of incentives, the Company uses the most likely method. Such estimates are subject to the estimation uncertainty.

## VII.   Physical verification of Inventory (Refer Note 14)

Bulk  inventory  for  the  Company  primarily comprises of coal, petcoke and clinker which are primarily used during the production process at the manufacturing locations. Determination of

physical quantities of bulk inventories is done based on volumetric measurements and involves special considerations with respect to physical measurement, density calculation, moisture, etc. which involve estimates / judgments.

VIII. For key estimates and judgements related to fair values refer note 54.

## 3.2  New and Amended Standards

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

## (i)    Definition of Accounting Estimates Amendments to Ind AS 8

The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.

The  amendments  had  no  impact  on  the Company's standalone financial statements.

## (ii)   Disclosure of Accounting Policies Amendments to Ind AS 1

The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 'material' accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in  making  decisions  about  accounting policy disclosures.

The amendments have had an impact on the Company's disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

presentation of any items in the Company's financial statements.

## (iii)   Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12

The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases.

The Company previously recognised for deferred tax on leases on a net basis. As a result of these amendments, the Company has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability

in relation to its right-of-use assets. Since, these balances qualify for offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 of Ind AS 12,there is no impact in the balance sheet. There was also no impact on the opening retained earnings as at 1 April 2023.

## 3.3  Amendments not yet effective:

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

## b) Demand from Competition Commission of India

- i) In 2012, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had imposed a penalty of ' 1,163.91 crore on the Company, concerning alleged contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002. On Company's appeal, Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT), initially stayed the penalty and by its final order dated December 11, 2015, set aside the order of the CCI, remanding the matter back to the CCI for fresh adjudication and for passing a fresh order.

After hearing the matter afresh, the CCI had again, by its order dated August 31, 2016, imposed a penalty of ' 1,163.91 crore on the Company. The Company filed an appeal against the said Order before the COMPAT. The COMPAT, vide its interim order dated November 21, 2016 has stayed the penalty with a condition to deposit 10% of the penalty amount, in the form of fixed deposit (the said condition has been complied with) and levy of interest of 12% p.a., in case the appeal is decided against the appellant. Meanwhile, pursuant to the notification issued by Central Government on May 26, 2017, any appeal, application or proceeding before COMPAT is transferred to National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

NCLAT, vide its Order dated July 25, 2018 dismissed the Company's appeal and upheld the CCI's order. Against this, the Company appealed to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which by its order dated October 05, 2018 admitted the appeal and directed to continue the interim order passed by the Tribunal.

- ii) In a separate matter, pursuant to a reference filed by the Director, Supplies and Disposals, Government of Haryana, the CCI by its Order dated January 19, 2017 had imposed a penalty of ' 29.84 crore on the Company. On Company's appeal, the COMPAT has stayed the operation of CCI's order. The matter is listed before NCLAT and is pending for hearing.

Based on the advice of external legal counsels, the Company believes it has good grounds on merit for a successful appeal in both the aforesaid matters. Accordingly, no provision is considered necessary and the matter has been disclosed as contingent liability along with interest of ' 1,003.56 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 867.90 crore).

## c) Sales tax incentive relating to:

A matter relating to 75% exemption from sales tax, granted by Government of Rajasthan. However, the eligibility of exemption in excess of 25% was contested by the State Government in a similar matter of another Company.

In year 2014, pursuant to the unfavourable decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that similar matter, the sales tax department initiated proceedings for recovery of differential sales tax and interest thereon on the ground that the Company had given an undertaking to deposit the differential amount of sales tax, in case decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court goes against in this matter.

Against the total demand of ' 239.77 crore (net of provision of ' 8.20 crore), including interest of ' 134.45 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 247.97 crore, including interest of ' 134.45 crore) the Company deposited ' 143.52 crore, including interest of ' 30.00 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 143.52 crore, including interest of ' 30.00 crore) towards sales tax under protest and filed a Special Leave Petition in the Hon'ble Supreme Court with one of the grounds that the tax exemption was availed by virtue of the order passed by the Board for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) during the relevant period. On Company's petition, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has granted an interim stay on the balance interest. Based on the advice of external legal counsel, the Company believes that, it has good grounds for a successful appeal. Accordingly, the amount has been disclosed as contingent liability.

## d) Excise, customs and service tax includes

A matter wherein service tax department issued show cause notices for denial of cenvat credit with regard to service tax paid on outward transportation for sale to customers on Freight On Road (F.O.R.) basis. Considering judicial precedents, Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) circular and based on legal opinion, the Company has assessed the matter as possible. Accordingly, ' 174.68 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 198.88 crore) has been disclosed as contingent liability.

## e) Stamp duty includes

A matter wherein the Collector of Stamps, Delhi vide its order dated  August 07, 2014, directed erstwhile Holcim (India) Private Limited (HIPL) (merged with the Company) to pay stamp duty (including penalty) of ' 287.88 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 287.88 crore) on the merger order passed by Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. HIPL had filed a writ petition and the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi granted an interim stay. Based on the advice of external legal counsel, the Company believes that it has good grounds for success in writ petition. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements.

## f) Income tax

The Company was entitled to excise duty incentives. The Company has been contending that the said incentives are in the nature of capital receipts and hence not liable to income tax. However, the Income tax department had consistently denied the position and considered these incentives as a taxable receipt. Appeals were filed by the Company against the orders of the Assessing Officer which were pending before the ITAT.

In November 2022, the Company received favourable orders from ITAT. However, pending final closure of the matter, inter-alia other matters, the amount of ' 243.50 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 372.01 crore) along with interest payable of ' 111.18 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 111.18 crore) has been disclosed as contingent liabilities.

To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.

Each year, the Board of Trustees and the Company review the level of funding. Such a review includes the assetliability matching strategy and assessment of the investment risk. The Company decides its contribution based on the results of this annual review.

The plans in India typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.

- i) Investment risk : As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted debt and equity instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk of impacts arising from fluctuation in interest rates and risks associated with equity market and related impairment.
- ii) Interest risk : A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
- iii) Salary risk : The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
- iv) Longevity risk : The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024

## Notes:

- i) The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.  Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from previous year.
- ii) The Company expects to contribute ' 4.34 crore to the trust managed Provident Fund in next year.

## C) Fair value measurements

The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and/or disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation techniques:

## a) Level 1

This level includes those financial instruments which are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

## b) Level 2

This level includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

## c) Level 3

This level includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

## Note:

- a) There was no transfer between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurement.
- b) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value (but fair value disclosures are required)

In the Company's opinion the carrying amount of loans, other financial assets, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents (excluding investments in liquid mutual funds), bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents, other financial liabilities (excluding derivative financial instruments) and trade payable recognised in the financial statement approximate their fair values largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

## c) Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of unquoted equity shares

## Assumption made in calculating the sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other post - retirement obligations and provisions.

## a) Commodity Price risk

Commodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to various external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. Since the energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to a drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company take following steps:

- i) Optimizing the fuel mix, pursue longer term and fixed contracts where considered necessary.
- ii) Consistent efforts to reduce the cost of power and fuel by using both domestic and international coal and petcoke.
- iii)    Use of alternative Fuel and Raw Materials (AFR) and enhancing the utilisation of renewable power including its onsite and offsite solar, wind, hydro power and Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS).

Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirements are monitored by the central procurement team.

## b) Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which fluctuate due to change in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates primarily relate to import of raw materials, fuels and capital items. Based on sensitivity analysis, the Company has well defined forex exposure threshold limit approved by Board of Directors, beyond which all forex exposure are fully hedged.

The carrying amounts of the Company's foreign currency denominated monetary assets at the end of the reporting periods expressed in ' , are as follows:

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers. The Company has credit evaluation policy for each customer and based on the evaluation credit limit of each customer is defined. The exposure in credit risk arising out of major customers is generally backed either by bank guarantee, letter of credit or security deposits.

The Company's exposure and wherever appropriate the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and spread amongst various counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the management of the Company.

The Company does not have higher concentration of credit risks since no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's net sales.

Total trade receivable as on March 31, 2024 is ' 716.81 crore (March 31, 2023 -' 564.91 crore).

Refer Note 15 for ageing of trade receivables.

## Financial assets other than trade receivables

The exposure to the Company arising out of this category consists of balances with banks investments in liquid mutual funds, incentives receivables from government and loans which do not pose any material credit risk. Such exposure is also controlled, reviewed and approved by the management of the Company on routine basis. There are no indications that defaults in payment obligations would occur in respect of these financial assets.

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalent, deposits with the banks / financial institutions is generally low as the said deposits have been made with the banks / financial institutions who have been assigned high credit rating by international and domestic credit rating agencies.

## Expected credit loss assessment

For trade receivables, as a practical expedient, the Company compute credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix is prepared based on historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At each reporting date, the historically observed default rates and changes in the forward-looking estimates are updated. Accordingly, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.

## Credit Impaired

For expected credit loss as at each reporting date the Company assesses position for the assets for which credit risk has not significantly increased from initial recognition, assets for which credit risk has increased significantly but are not credit impaired and for assets for which credit risk has increased significantly and are credit impaired. The Company assesses detrimental impacts on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset including loans, receivables and other assets. Based on the assessment of the observable data relating to significant financial difficulty and creditworthiness of the counterparties, the management believes that there are no financial assets which are credit impaired except as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

## C) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at reasonable price. The Company's treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. The Company has invested in short term liquid funds which can be redeemed on a very short notice and hence carried negligible liquidity risk.

has not received any order, notice or other communication from the SEBI in the matter. Accordingly, as at reporting date there is no open matter relating to the Company, and any noncompliance of applicable regulations.

In April 23, the Company had obtained a legal opinion by independent law firm, confirming (a) none of the alleged related parties mentioned in the short-seller report were related parties to the Company or its subsidiaries, under applicable frameworks; and (b) the Company is in compliance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations.

Such independent review also did not identify any non-compliances or irregularities by the Company, and it has noted on record, the results of this review.

Based on the legal opinions obtained, subsequent independent review referred to above, the SC order and the fact that there are no pending regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings as of date, management concludes that there are no consequences of the allegations mentioned in the SSR and other allegations on the Company, and accordingly, these financial statements do not have any reporting adjustments in this regard.
